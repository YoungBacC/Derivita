## 3.5 Example 7
Notes: Make the polynomial a quartic with one zero a repeated root like in the example. Leading coefficient 
could be positive or negative, probably random_exclude(-8,8,0). Randomize zeros and extra given point. Make 
the zeros integers. Present a Desmos graph with labeled points. For coding, start with factored form for ease.

## 3.5
3.5 Duplicate above question but make it a quintic with two repeated roots that are integers, and one root 
that is a non-integer rational number.

## 3.7 The Remainder Theorem
Slide 17 fill in the blank for [f(c)]. Let f be a polynomial function. When f(x) is divided by x−c, the remainder 
is [f(c)].

## 3.7 Example 6
Duplicate this example. Randomize the polynomial. Ask students what the remainder is, and then multiple choice 
for “IS the poly divisible by the factor?” Give them two factors to check, one of which is a factor (remainder is 0).
