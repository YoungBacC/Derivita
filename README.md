2.2 Find the range of the following functions using the graph.<br/>

    (a) y=mx+b
    (b) x^even + C, powers:=[2,4,6,8,10], C:= random_exclude(-10,10,0)
    (c) -x^even + C, powers:=[2,4,6,8,10], C:= random_exclude(-10,10,0)
    (d) y=ax^3+bx^2+c, a,b,c in random(2,10), allow a to be negative
    (e) Root function (ax+b)^(1/r)+C. r:= low even number, C:= random_exclude(-10,10,0)
    (f) Root function (ax+b)^(1/r)+C. r:= low odd number, C:= random_exclude(-10,10,0)
    (g) e^x+C (show asymptote on graph) C:= random(-10,10)
    (h) ln(x-B) (show asymptote on graph) B:= random(-10,10)

Notes: Present a formula and a graph for each of the following functions and ask the student to give the range in 
interval notation and set-builder notation. See q2.1.20 for how I was allowing students to enter interval notation 
(may be buggy though, let's talk about it). Probably lock_viewport:=true. Feedback should include mention that the 
range is related to the output value. Donâ€™t ask about domain in this question, but leave it as a possibility in the 
future when deciding on variable names in your code.
