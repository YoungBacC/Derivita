## Q3.5.7 Duplicate this as Q3.5.8, but…
	-Have it pass through a point different than the y-int
	-Make it degree 6 and have an irrational sqrt root and its conjugate
	-Ask students to use the EXPAND command on WolframAlpha to expand it into standard form, 
        and give standard form 
        as part (b). Hyperlink the Mathematica documentation at the command.

## Q3.5.7 Duplicate this as Q3.5.9, but…
	-Have it pass through a point different than the y-int
	-Make it degree 6 and have an irrational sqrt root [like 1+sqrt(3)] and its conjugate
	-Ask students to use the EXPAND command on WolframAlpha to expand it into standard form, 
    and give standard form 
    as part (b). Hyperlink the Mathematica documentation at the command.

## Q3.5.7 Duplicate this as Q3.5.10, but…
	-Have it pass through a point different than the y-int
	-Make it degree 5 and have an irrational sqrt  root and NOT its conjugate
	-Ask students to use the EXPAND command on WolframAlpha to expand it into standard form, 
    and give standard form 
    as part (b). Hyperlink the Mathematica documentation at the command.

## 3.7 Duplicate Q3.5.8 after the above and put this in section 3.7, but…
	-Have it pass through a point different than the y-int
	-Make it degree 6 and have a complex root and its conjugate
	-Ask students to use the EXPAND command on WolframAlpha to expand it into standard form, 
    and give standard form 
    as part (b). Hyperlink the Mathematica documentation at the command.

## 3.7 Duplicate Q3.5.8 after the above and put this in section 3.7, but…
	-Have it pass through a point different than the y-int
	-Make it degree 6 and have a complex root [like 1+3i] and its conjugate
	-Ask students to use the EXPAND command on WolframAlpha to expand it into standard form, 
    and give standard form 
    as part (b). Hyperlink the Mathematica documentation at the command.

## 3.7 Duplicate from 3.7 after the above and put this in section 3.7, but…
	-Have it pass through a point different than the y-int
	-Make it degree 4 and have a complex root and its NOT conjugate
	-Ask students to use the EXPAND command on WolframAlpha to expand it into standard form, 
    and give standard form 
    as part (b). Hyperlink the Mathematica documentation at the command.
