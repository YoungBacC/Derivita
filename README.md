## 2.5 Decomposing functions
Express the function h(x) in the form gof by decomposing it into a composition of non-identity functions. h(x) = (x^p+A)^q 
A:=random_exclude(-10,10,0), p,q:= random(2,10) q!=p.

## 2.5 Decomposing functions
Express the function H(x) in the form fogoh by decomposing it into a composition of non-identity functions. 
H(x) = (A+|x|)^(1/r) a:=random_exclude(-10,10,0), r:= random(2,10), show radical symbol.

## 2.5 Decomposing functions 
Express the function h(x) in the form coboa by decomposing it into a composition of non-identity functions. 
h(x) = sin(A-x^p) A:=random_exclude(-10,10,0), p:= random(2,10)

## Duplicate 3.3.3
Have the constant term be a non-perfect square. Factor over R. Careful with checking; there are equivalent radicals.
<br/>
<br/>
## 3.3 Quadratic Formula
Multiple choice, identify the quadratic formula, select all that apply. See Q5.4.2 for code structure. See slide 21 from 3.3 
for formula structure. Include this structure, and the standard structure where everything is over one fraction bar.

## 3.3 Solve Using Quadratic Formula
Make discriminant NOT a perfect square. In feedback show graph of parabola and x-intercepts labeled as seen on slide 23 
(sans arrows).

<br/>
## 3.3 Solve Using Quadratic Formula
Make discriminant BE a perfect square. Mention in solutions that this means it could have been factored over Z instead. 
In feedback show graph of parabola and x-intercepts labeled as seen on slide 23 (sans arrows).

<br/>
## 3.3 Solve Using Quadratic Formula
Make discriminant equal 0. This gives a double root. Mention in solutions that this means it could have been factored 
over Z instead. In feedback show graph of parabola and x-intercept labeled as seen on slide 23 (sans arrows).
