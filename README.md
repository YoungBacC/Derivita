## 2.2 Find the range of the following functions using the graph.<br/>

    (a) y=mx+b
    (b) x^even + C, powers:=[2,4,6,8,10], C:= random_exclude(-10,10,0)
    (c) -x^even + C, powers:=[2,4,6,8,10], C:= random_exclude(-10,10,0)
    (d) y=ax^3+bx^2+c, a,b,c in random(2,10), allow a to be negative
    (e) Root function (ax+b)^(1/r)+C. r:= low even number, C:= random_exclude(-10,10,0)
    (f) Root function (ax+b)^(1/r)+C. r:= low odd number, C:= random_exclude(-10,10,0)
    (g) e^x+C (show asymptote on graph) C:= random(-10,10)
    (h) ln(x-B) (show asymptote on graph) B:= random(-10,10)

Notes: Present a formula and a graph for each of the following functions and ask the student to give the range in 
interval notation and set-builder notation. See q2.1.20 for how I was allowing students to enter interval notation 
(may be buggy though, let's talk about it). Probably lock_viewport:=true. Feedback should include mention that the 
range is related to the output value. Donâ€™t ask about domain in this question, but leave it as a possibility in the 
future when deciding on variable names in your code.

## 2.5 Decomposing functions
Express the function h(x) in the form gof by decomposing it into a composition of non-identity functions. h(x) = (x^p+A)^q 
A:=random_exclude(-10,10,0), p,q:= random(2,10) q!=p.

## 2.5 Decomposing functions
Express the function H(x) in the form fogoh by decomposing it into a composition of non-identity functions. 
H(x) = (A+|x|)^(1/r) a:=random_exclude(-10,10,0), r:= random(2,10), show radical symbol.

## 2.5 Decomposing functions 
Express the function h(x) in the form coboa by decomposing it into a composition of non-identity functions. 
h(x) = sin(A-x^p) A:=random_exclude(-10,10,0), p:= random(2,10)

## Duplicate 3.3.3
Have the constant term be a non-perfect square. Factor over R. Careful with checking; there are equivalent radicals.
<br/>
<br/>
## 3.3 Quadratic Formula
Multiple choice, identify the quadratic formula, select all that apply. See Q5.4.2 for code structure. See slide 21 from 3.3 
for formula structure. Include this structure, and the standard structure where everything is over one fraction bar.

## 3.3 Solve Using Quadratic Formula
Make discriminant NOT a perfect square. In feedback show graph of parabola and x-intercepts labeled as seen on slide 23 
(sans arrows).

<br/>
## 3.3 Solve Using Quadratic Formula
Make discriminant BE a perfect square. Mention in solutions that this means it could have been factored over Z instead. 
In feedback show graph of parabola and x-intercepts labeled as seen on slide 23 (sans arrows).

<br/>
## 3.3 Solve Using Quadratic Formula
Make discriminant equal 0. This gives a double root. Mention in solutions that this means it could have been factored 
over Z instead. In feedback show graph of parabola and x-intercept labeled as seen on slide 23 (sans arrows).
