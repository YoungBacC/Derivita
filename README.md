2.2.4 (NEEDS SOLUTION because I dont know how the solution should be formatted. Beware of lag because of the amount of 
desmos graphs!!!)<br/>

# In Progress
## 3.3 Quadratic Formula
Multiple choice, identify the quadratic formula, select all that apply. See Q5.4.2 for code structure. See slide 21 from 3.3 
for formula structure. Include this structure, and the standard structure where everything is over one fraction bar.
<br/>
<br/>
## 3.3 Solve Using Quadratic Formula
Make discriminant equal 0. This gives a double root. Mention in solutions that this means it could have been factored 
over Z instead. In feedback show graph of parabola and x-intercept labeled as seen on slide 23 (sans arrows).
